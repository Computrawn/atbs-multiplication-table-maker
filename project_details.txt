Multiplication Table Maker
Create a program multiplicationTable.py that takes a number N from the command line 
and creates an N×N multiplication table in an Excel spreadsheet. 
For example, when the program is run like this:
py multiplicationTable.py 6

. . . it should create a spreadsheet that looks like Figure 13-11.

Row 1 and column A should be used for labels and should be in bold.
